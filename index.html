      PayPal typically uses its own internal currency conversion rates when
      processing transactions involving different currencies. These rates can
      vary slightly from the publicly available rates you might find on
      platforms like Coinbase or other currency converters. PayPal's conversion
      rates are usually updated regularly and are applied when converting one
      currency to another during transactions. Therefore, while external
      converters like "pyusd" on Coinbase can provide a good estimate, the exact
      conversion rate used by PayPal may differ slightly due to factors such as
      market fluctuations and PayPal's own currency exchange policies.

      currently this application uses the coinbase api for the conversion rate
      and assumes standard rate for commercial domestic transactions to be:
      3.49% + fixed fee of 0.49USD when using PayPal Checkout and PayPal Guest
      Checkout.<br />
